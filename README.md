# Mapping_Earthquakes

BackGround- Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
Using our knowledeg of we had to map major earthquakes around the world. 
This was truly an interesing challenge!
